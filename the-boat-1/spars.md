#### SPINNAKER POLE

The spinnaker pole is a 100 mm diameter aluminum alloy tubing 4700 mm long, manufactured by Chesapeake Rigging. The inboard end is equipped with a socket that attaches to a fitting on the spinnaker track car. The outboard end of the pole has a fitting to accept the spinnaker afterguy. When not in use, the spinnaker pole is stowed in starboard deck chocks on the foredeck.

#### REACHING STRUT

T he reaching strut is a 2200 mm, aluminum alloy tubing, manufactured by Chesapeake Rigging. It is equipped with an inboard socket fitting that attaches to a fitting mounted on the outboard side of the mast approximately 600 mm above the cabin top. The outboard end has a fitting to accept the spinnaker afterguy to route it outboard of the stanchions. The reaching strut must be rigged before easing the pole to the headstay to prevent the afterguy from bending the stanchions.

The reaching strut is used with the spinnaker when the apparent wind angle is forward of the beam. This reduces chafe on the afterguy, and increases the mechanical advantage of the load on the afterguy to help keep the spinnaker pole from touching the headstay when close reaching, especially in a seaway.
