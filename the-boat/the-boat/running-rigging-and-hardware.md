# Running Rigging and Hardware

#### HALYARDS



T he masthead is fitted with five \(5\) Delrin sheaves on which the halyards turn; one for the mainsail, one for the port jib/genoa, one for the starboard jib/genoa, and two spinnaker sheaves. The halyards all are rigged to travel internally through the mast to deck level.

* he two spinnaker halyards pass through external blocks attached to welded cranes on each side of the forward face of the masthead. At the base of the mast, they are led through turning blocks to the forward port and starboard winches on the cabin top.
* The two jib/genoa halyards are led through turning blocks to the middle port and starboard winches on the cabin top.
* The main halyard is led through a turning block at the base of the mast to the aft winch on the starboard side of the cabin top.NOTE: Do not over tension main halyard.
* A topping lift/staysail halyard is used to control the vertical position of the outboard end of the spinnaker pole and as a halyard for a staysail and storm jib. It is led to a sheave located on the front of the mast just below the inner forestay attachment and descends inside the mast, exiting on the lower port side to a deck-mounted swivel turning block. The line is led through a rope clutch, then to the aft port side winch.
